### Driving Sustainable Innovation in Logistics

At **Greenwing**, we believe in a world with **lower CO₂ emissions** and a more sustainable future. Our focus is on **logistics and trucking**, where digital solutions can make a real impact in reducing emissions and improving efficiency.

---

## 🌍 Our Vision
A future where logistics operates **smarter, cleaner, and more efficiently**, contributing to a **sustainable world with reduced CO₂ emissions**.

## 🚀 Our Mission
We leverage **digitalization and data-driven solutions** to transform logistics, making sustainability an achievable and measurable goal.

## 🚨 The Problem  

A **lack of data on sustainability** is preventing the logistics industry from making informed decisions. This results in:  
- 🔍 Limited insight for sustainable decision-making.  
- ❌ Insufficient data to develop smarter, more efficient solutions.  

We are exploring multiple challenges to understand where we can make the biggest impact. Here are two key examples:  

### 🚛 Example 1: Dead Miles in Long-Haul Trucking  
Long-haul trucks often run empty between deliveries, leading to:  
- ⛽ Wasted fuel and increased CO₂ emissions.  
- 💸 Higher operational costs for fleet operators.  
- ⚡ Challenges for electric trucks, which require strategic charging.  

### 📜 Example 2: Sustainability Legislation Challenges  
New regulations push the industry toward lower emissions, but many companies struggle due to:  
- 🚧 Low-emission zones restricting traditional trucks.  
- 🔋 New vehicle types (EVs, hydrogen, etc.) requiring infrastructure shifts.  
- 📊 Complex compliance requirements with limited access to accurate data.  

We will continue to assess these and other challenges to determine where we can drive the most meaningful change.
